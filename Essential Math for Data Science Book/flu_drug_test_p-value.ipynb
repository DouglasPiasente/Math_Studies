    "When we say something is statistically significant, what do we mean by that? We hear it used loosely and frequently but what does it mean mathematically? Technically, it has to do with something called the p-value, which is a hard concept for many folks to grasp. But I think the concept of p-values makes more sense when you trace it back to its invention. While this is an imperfect example, it gets across some big ideas.\n",

    "In 1925, mathematician Ronald Fisher was at a party. One of his colleagues Muriel Bristol claimed she could detect when tea was poured before milk simply by tasting it. Intrigued by the claim, Ronald set up an experiment on the spot.\n",
    "\n",
    "He prepared eight cups of tea. Four had milk poured first; the other four had tea poured first. He then presented them to his connoisseur colleague and asked her to identify the pour order for each. Remarkably, she identified them all correctly, and the probability of this happening by chance is 1 in 70, or 0.01428571.\n",
    "\n",
    "This 1.4% probability is what we call the p-value, the probability of something occurring by chance rather than because of a hypothesized explanation. Without going down a rabbit hole of combinatorial math, the probability that Muriel completely guessed the cups correctly is 1.4%. What exactly does that tell you?\n",
    "\n",
    "When we frame an experiment, whether it is determining if organic donuts cause weight gain or living near power lines causes cancer, we always have to entertain the possibility that random luck played a role. Just like there is a 1.4% chance Muriel identified the cups of tea correctly simply by guessing, there’s always a chance randomness just gave us a good hand like a slot machine. This helps us frame our null hypothesis (H0), saying that the variable in question had no impact on the experiment and any positive results are just random luck. The alternative hypothesis (H1) poses that a variable in question (called the controlled variable) is causing a positive result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, the threshold for statistical significance is a p-value of 5% or less, or .05. Since .014 is less than .05, this would mean we can reject our null hypothesis that Muriel was randomly guessing. We can then promote the alternative hypothesis that Muriel had a special ability to detect whether tea or milk was poured first.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now one thing this tea-party example did not capture is that when we calculate a p-value, we capture all probability of that event or rarer."
