    "A quick and surefire way to shoot yourself in the foot is to collect data on people and use it to make predictions haphazardly. Not only can data privacy concerns come about, but legal and PR issues can emerge if the model is found to be discriminatory. Input variables like race and gender can become weighted from machine learning training. After that, undesirable outcomes are inflicted on those demographics like not being hired or being denied loans. More extreme applications include being falsely flagged by surveillance systems or being denied criminal parole. Note too that seemingly benign variables like commute time have been found to correlate with discriminatory variables.\n",
